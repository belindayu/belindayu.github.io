                I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz</a> studying <a href="https://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/tim.html" target="_blank">Technology and Information Management</a>.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently teaching myself front-end development through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/"  target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and building this site, so it's a work in progress! Thank you for checking it out though!
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am a few final projects away from completing the Responsive Web Design Certiifcation and am working on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
                <br><br>
                In the meantime, feel free to shoot me an email or a LinkedIn message, I'd be happy to chat 😃

                <b style="letter-spacing:1px">Why I decided to get into front-end development:</b><br><br>I have always thought it was interesting to learn about why we perceive certain formats/structures/colors more appealing than others in addition to the complexity and design process that goes into building the seemingly ordinary things we use everyday.<br><br>I remember that I first learned about some of this from reading various articles on UI/UX on Medium (one of my favorite sites!).<br><br>I knew I liked seeing the visual side of coding and designing, whether it was a website or a flyer for a club event, so that it was visually pleasing and user-friendly.<br><br>So, I took this as a sign that front-end development may be a good path for me and finally took a leap on a HTML/CSS course! I now view every website I go on differently, knowing that it had to be built from scratch. I'm eager to learn how to build a responsive and useful website for others to use!
