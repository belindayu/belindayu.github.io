                I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz</a> studying <a href="https://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/tim.html" target="_blank">Technology and Information Management</a>.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently teaching myself front-end development through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/"  target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and building this site, so it's a work in progress!<br>Thank you for checking it out though!
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am a few final projects away from completing the Responsive Web Design Certiifcation and am working on the <br>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
                <br><br>
                In the meantime, feel free to shoot me an email or a LinkedIn message, I'd be happy to chat 😃

                <b style="letter-spacing:1px">Here's why I decided to get into front-end development 👇
                </b><br><br>
                I have always thought it was interesting to learn about why we perceive certain formats/structures/colors more appealing than others in addition to the complexity and design process that goes into creating the seemingly ordinary things we use everyday.
                <br><br>
                I remember that I first learned about some of this, and still do, from reading various articles about <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/">UI/UX on Medium</a> (one of my favorite sites!).
                <br><br>
                I knew I liked seeing the visual side of coding and designing, whether it was a website or a flyer for a club event, so that it was visually pleasing and user-friendly.
                <br><br>
                So, I took this as a sign that front-end development may be a good path for me and finally took a leap on a HTML/CSS course! I now view every website I go on differently, knowing that it had to be built from scratch.<br>I think it's pretty cool that I can build something that many people will see and use, so I'm eager to learn about how all that works!
